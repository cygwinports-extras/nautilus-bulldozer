ldesc: "Bulldozer is an extension for the Nautilus File Manager
integrating your build system. If it finds some build script in your
current directory, it extends Nautilus by buttons and menu entries for
accessing the build targets found in the build script.

Currently only make scripts are supported, but support for alternate
tools like Ant and NAnt is planed."
